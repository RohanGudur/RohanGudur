## ðŸš§ Under Construction
Hey,This profile is a work in progress â€” I'm gradually porting my untiled1,2,3... collab notebooks experiments, CUDA kernels here

My main interest lies in **machine learning systems** â€” especially building and understanding the training and inference pipelines end-to-end.

Right now, I'm focused on:
- Writing efficient CUDA kernels
- Understanding GPU-level optimizations
- Exploring system-level design for ML training (Megatron , FSDP)

I'm currently ranked **#58** on the global leaderboard at [leetgpu.com](https://leetgpu.com), a platform for solving low-level GPU programming challenges.
more to come soon ðŸš€
